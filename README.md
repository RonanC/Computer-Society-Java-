About
-----
I had just created the GMIT Computer society and I had to come up with an idea for a Java application that would showcase Object Orientated software development with a strong emphasis on Polymorphism.

This application lets users view information about the society, fill out a questionnaire, view the current members (by type) and of course sign up to be a member.

The idea behind it was that during society sign up day, pen and paper sign ups were took too much time to transcript afterwards. So I wanted to have an automated way to sign up members.


Tools used
-----
This application was developed using Java in the Eclipse IDE
